### Hi there üëã

I'm J√©r√¥me Gamez, a platform and backend engineer with 20+ years of experience.
I build [elvah](https://www.elvah.de) during the day and Open Source Software
at night.

I'm a Jack of all trades with a soft spot for PHP, legacy software and,
of course, Open Source software.

My hobby is my job and vice versa. My mission is to make the work of all
developers (myself included) more productive and enjoyable.
I have a special affinity for code quality, stability, and legacy software,
and consider no code base to be unmaintainable üí™üèª.

My most prolific project is the (unofficial)
[Firebase Admin SDK for PHP](https://github.com/kreait/firebase-php) and its
related libraries, which are
[downloaded 500K+ times a month](https://packagist.org/packages/kreait/firebase-php/stats), but I also publish and maintain many more Open Source
projects in the [BESTE](https://github.com/beste),
[kreait](https://github.com/kreait), and my
[personal](https://github.com/jeromegamez) GitHub organizations.
